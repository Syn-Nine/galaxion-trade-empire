### How to Play:
Planets
- Population Menu - Use this menu to determine the allocation of population to different jobs, like making food, labor work, and scientific research.
- Manufacturing Menu - Use this menu to allocate manufacturing capacity to different areas. These goods can be used for trading or building fighter craft.
- Research Menu - Use this menu to determine what the planet researches. This will affect the planet's production.
- Cargo and Hangar Bay - Use this menu to transfer from the planet to your freighter.

Stations
- Trade - Use this menu to buy and sell goods at the station.
- Terra Link - Use this menu to see the status of your planets.
- Market Link - Use this menu to see prices at other known stations.
- Nav Center - Use this menu to download new navigation maps to the local regions and other stations.
- Houses - This menu shows the status of the other known royal houses in the galaxy.

Galaxy View
- The galaxy view allows navigation of your freighter to other planets and stations.
- From this view you can also access your cargo status or attack planets.

Combat
- When you attack a planet, the royal house controlling the planet will attempt to defend their territory.
- You can demand or offer a 10% tribute of freighter holds to end the attack early without surrender.
- Surrender yields 50% of freighter holds. If the defender surrenders you take control of the planet.

Capture all planets to win the game.
