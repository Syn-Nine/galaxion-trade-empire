### How to Play:

Combat
- When you attack a planet, the royal house controlling the planet will attempt to defend their territory.
- You can demand or offer a 10% tribute of freighter holds to end the attack early without surrender.
- Surrender yields 50% of freighter holds. If the defender surrenders you take control of the planet.
- Click the cell location to move/attack. The further the target, the lower probability of hit.
- Hotkeys: F-move forward, SPACE-skip turn, A-attack weakest nearby enemy.
- You can click the auto button to turn on auto-battle.

Art Credit:
- This game was made for a gamejam during the month of October 2023 and uses background images that were created at open.ai to speed up prototyping. These images are not copyrightable. All of the small sprite graphics were created by me. If I ever release the game commercially I'll make sure to replace the AI art with human made art.
